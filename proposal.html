            <header>Project Topic: Convert Spotify Playlists into Bandcamp Links to Directly Support Artists</header>
            <section class="middleboxes">
                The RESTful APIs that will be used for this site are the Spotify API and the Bandcamp API.<br/><br/>
                The site will use the Spotify API to pull in the data from a playlist the user enters, then the Bandcamp API will be used to get the Bandcamp links for the songs in the playlists.<br/><br/>
                I want to also use the Spotify API to use the users' playlist to suggest other artists the user might enjoy, then return the Bandcamp links for those artists.<br/><br/>
                To sign up for the site, I'll ask for the users' first and last name, email, and date of birth. I'll also be collecting the users' Spotify login information, however I'm not sure if I will be storing that yet.<br/><br/>
                Possible DB tables and attributes:
                <ul>
                    <li>USER -> user_id, first_name, last_name, dob, email, password, spotify_user_id</li>
                    <li>ARTIST -> artist_id, artist_spotify_id, artist_name, artist_bc_link</li>
                    <li>SONG -> song_id, song_spotify_id, song_name, song_bc_link</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="middleboxes">
                The people I see potentially using my site are people who want to directly support the artsits they enjoy on Spotify, since Bandcamp purchases go directly to the artist and streaming pays an average of $0.004 per stream.<br/><br/>
                Goals I have for my site are to promote directly supporting artists, and to make it easier to do so.<br/>
                A large reason why people use streaming is convenience. This site would eliminate having to physically search for each song on Bandcamp, which would remove a lot of the inconvenience.<br/><br/>
                I chose this topic because music and supporting musicians is something that's important to me, specifically local artists who get the most screwed over by streaming.
